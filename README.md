# R2D2
## How to install
Git clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/lars-vc/r2d2
```
Then go into the project and compile it for your machine 
Also comes with a precompiled version that might work for your system if you don't want to install the rust compiler (building is recommended)
```
cd r2d2
cargo build --release
```
Lastly alias R2D2 for easy access (put this in your .bashrc to make this change permanent)
```
alias r2d2='/absolute/path/to/r2d2/target/release/r2d2'
```
## Why the name R2D2
Because he is a robot assistent (and my favorite starwars character :p)!
